# Exchange

## What?
This is a remake of hackcoinbot - a bot that facilitated a game of buying and selling stocks and cryptocurrencies in Slack! It starts you off with a balance, which users will use to try to grow their fortunes. This is simply a game and does not take into account the various factors that would actually go into doing it in real life!


## How?
Compile it with `go build` and just run the executable providing the API token as well as verification as environment variables.
